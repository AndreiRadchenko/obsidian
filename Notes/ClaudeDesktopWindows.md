# Installing Claude Desktop on Windows

## Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or later.
- Administrative privileges to install software.
- Internet connection for downloading the installer.

## Steps
1. **Download the Installer**
   - Visit the official Claude website or the dedicated download page.
   - Click on *Download for Windows* to get the `.exe` file.

2. **Run the Installer**
   - Locate the downloaded `ClaudeDesktopSetup.exe`.
   - Double‑click to launch. If prompted by UAC, click *Yes*.
   - Follow the on‑screen wizard: accept license terms, choose install location (default is fine), and click *Install*.

3. **Launch Claude Desktop**
   - After installation, you can start the app from the Start menu or by double‑clicking the desktop shortcut.
   - The first run will prompt you to sign in or create an Anthropic account.

4. **Configure Settings (Optional)**
   - Open the *Settings* panel from the sidebar.
   - Adjust language, theme, and notification preferences to your liking.

## Free Claude Restrictions
- **Model Access**: The free tier typically provides access to the *Claude 3 Haiku* model, which is less powerful than higher‑tier models.
- **Usage Limits**: Expect a daily or monthly token limit (e.g., 100,000 tokens per month). Exceeding this may require a paid plan.
- **Feature Access**: Some advanced features (e.g., higher‑resolution images, longer context windows) may be disabled in the free version.
- **Support**: Free users receive community support; priority help is reserved for paid subscribers.

> **Tip**: Keep an eye on the *Usage* tab in the app to monitor token consumption and avoid hitting limits unexpectedly.
